This backpack students list is made by using Backpack for Laravel. (https://backpackforlaravel.com/)

It is a dance school student list webpage with a customized backend admin panel.

In the front end you see the list of the students and lessons and by calling the "url/admin", you are then directed to the login page for the admin panel.

After logging in you see the dashboard to control the students list.

In the admin panel you can read, create, edit, delete the student list and lesson list. 

You can also make backups and also see the logs to be able to check if and when something went wrong.

By using a template which is in the resources/views/pages folder you can easily create a new web page.
